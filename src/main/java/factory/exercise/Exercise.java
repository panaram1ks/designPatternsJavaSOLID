/**
 * Factory Coding Exercise
 *
 * You are given a class called Person . The person has two fields: id , and name .
 *
 * Please implement a non-static PersonFactory that has a createPerson()  method that takes a person's name and returns a new instance of Person .
 *
 * The id  of the person returned should be set as a 0-based index of the object created by that factory. So, the first person the factory makes should have id=0, second id=1 and so on.
